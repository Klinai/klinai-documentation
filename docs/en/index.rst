=========
Klinai is an adapter for `CouchDB`_ that is able to manage several CouchDB at the same time.
This Library is based on *PHP* 5.4+ and *Zend-Http* 2.2.3+.
CouchDB is working `stateless`_, so Klinai was designed to make use of those advantages.
As a result the construction of references across database-borders is simplified.
